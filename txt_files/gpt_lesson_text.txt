          "content": "Each April, in the village of Maeliya in northwest Sri Lanka, Pinchal Weldurelage Siriwardene gathers his community under the shade of a large banyan tree. The tree overlooks a human-made body of water called a wewa – meaning reservoir or \"tank\" in Sinhala. The wewa stretches out besides the village's rice paddies for 175-acres (708,200 sq m) and is filled with the rainwater of preceding months.    \n\nSiriwardene, the 76-year-old secretary of the village's agrarian committee, has a tightly-guarded ritual to perform. By boiling coconut milk on an open hearth beside the tank, he will seek blessings for a prosperous harvest from the deities residing in the tree. \"It's only after that we open the sluice gate to water the rice fields,\" he told me when I visited on a scorching mid-April afternoon.\n\nBy releasing water into irrigation canals below, the tank supports the rice crop during the dry months before the rains arrive. For nearly two millennia, lake-like water bodies such as this have helped generations of farmers cultivate their fields. An old Sinhala phrase, \"wewai dagabai gamai pansalai\", even reflects the technology's centrality to village life; meaning \"tank, pagoda, village and temple\"."

Prompt text:
Master Reef Guide Kirsty Whitman didn't need to tell me twice. Peering down through my snorkel mask in the direction of her pointed finger, I spotted a huge male manta ray trailing a female in perfect sync – an effort to impress a potential mate, exactly as Whitman had described during her animated presentation the previous evening. Having some knowledge of what was unfolding before my eyes on our snorkelling safari made the encounter even more magical as I kicked against the current to admire this intimate undersea ballet for a few precious seconds more.
